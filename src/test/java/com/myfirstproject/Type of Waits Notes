1. Hard Wait : Thread.sleep(millisecond)
Java wait.
Waits for the given time. NO MORE NO LESS.
We should avoid using this wait. Avoid especially putting too many hard wait.
This will make the test execution time longer.

2. Dynamic Wait

Implicit Wait: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(30));
Selenium wait
Wait UP TO the given time.
We should use dynamic wait
Global wait. When you use implicit wait once, then whenever driver is called, then implicit wait applies.

ExplicitWait:
Selenium wait. Dynamic wait
Wait UP TO the given time.
We should use dynamic wait
Local wait. We will apply the wait on to the specific elements
We must create a WebDriverWait object

Element is not visible
Element no clickable
Text not displayed
â€¦.
Fluent Wait:
